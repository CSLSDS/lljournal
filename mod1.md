# Module 1 Inquiry  
## What questions did you ask your stakeholder that helped in breaking down your tasks?  
"Who are our users?" "What exepectations do you have for the application of data science to this project?"  

## What user stories did you draw from to create your product roadmap? List them below.  
### Big Picture story:  
"as a user I can have one place to go to compare myriad unrelated metrics between multiple cities at the same time."  
### little stories:  
as a user, i can...  
- navigate to a deployed app  
- search for cities by name  
- compare up to 3 cities  
- view historical housing prices  
- create an account and sign in  
- filter city data  
- save cities and view then view them  
- compare projections of future metrics of cities  
  
## Select your favorite user story. What are the tasks that need to be accomplished in order to ship that particular user story?   
  
"As a user, I can compare up to 3 cities"  
Tasks to be accomplished:  
DS search for reliable, thorough data  
DS clean all data   
DS finalize cleaned data source to provide web  
BE deploy web API endpoint for city data  
FE pull in/display data via api requests, mapping over json  
FE style city data in a way that makes comparison easy  
FE web accessibility for disabilities  
  
## What did you do well in this task breakdown process?   
...breaking down tasks into more and more discrete tasks  
## What were some challenges?  
...anticipating and understanding the scope of web's capabilities and responsibilities  
  
## After what youâ€™ve learned in this process, given a new product roadmap, how would you approach it differently?   
...likely ask better, more user-focused questions of stakeholders, and have a clearer sense of what a web team can accomplish, and what DS has to bring to the table.  
  
## What would you change about the way you go about breaking down individual tasks?  
...break them down even further, and waste less time with questions over who does what.
