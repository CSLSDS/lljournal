1. What technical choices did you make today?  
>> Most choices were (thankfully) dictated by our excellent documentation for Labs. The team considered and determined what data will be managed by Web and what data will be managed by DS, and how they could and should interoperate together.   
2. Pick two technical choices youâ€™re happy with. What was your thought process as you made those choices? What did you consider and what did you decide against? 
>> Differentiating which aspects of data persistence are the responsibility of Web and what should fall to DS; I took into consideration what I understood to be the appropriate background based on prior curriculum of the DS team, and my naivete of the capabilities and understandings of Web, and erred on the side of taking more responsibility for the data we're tasked with gathering, in particular. To minimize the complexity and reinforce the achievability of MVP, I've considered ways to streamline the data delivery, including making predictions static features provided with the rest of the city entries, and simpler endpoints for validating user inputs when searching available cities.   
  - Take a moment to think about the advantages in choosing the route that you did.  
  - Now take a moment to consider the disadvantages.  
3. In one or two sentences, summarize why you ultimately made the choice you did  
>> Ultimately, minimizing the complexity of overlap in what each team is responsible for helps to keep all expectations and goals clearer and more discrete, and as our DS team is expected to be able to serve multiple Web teams, keeping our responsibilities clearly delineated and robustly managed by ourselves only minimizes the risk of confusion or frustration on the part of the other teams we're serving.  
4. Extracting useful conclusions from your process:  
  - According to your understanding, what makes a good technical choice?  
>> A good technical choice is one that takes into account what's been done before, what's possible, considereds potential unforseen consequences, worst-case-scenarios, inter-team stressors, and expectations of all involved, and after weighing these with appropriate research, thought, and consultation between all participants, ideally the conclusions and choices will be as in-line with requirements and smooth operation as is feasible.
